Dear Supervisors,In the Colab notebook AbstractClassification_LLMs.ipynb, we have implemented three different approaches to medical abstract classification using Large Language Models.To run the notebook successfully, please follow these instructions:--> In the section "Load Data", adjust the file paths to point to the folder containing the downloaded HuggingFaceData. This is noted in the corresponding comment within the code.--> Please do not execute the 1st Approach (with fine-tuning), as training the model can take approximately one hour. The corresponding results are already included in the final report. This is also noted in the code section itself.--> All other cells can be executed without modification.Best regards,Gruppe 10
